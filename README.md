# Student Enrollment Form - Using JsonPowerDB

## Description
This project is a **Student Enrollment Form** built with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for the frontend, while the backend is powered by **JsonPowerDB** for data storage. The form allows users to enter student data (like Roll Number, Name, Class, etc.) and interact with the database for storing and updating records. The primary key in this form is the **Roll Number**.

### Technologies Used:
- Frontend: **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Bootstrap**
- Backend: **JsonPowerDB** (JPDB)
- Database: **JsonPowerDB** (Database operations like checking, saving, and updating student data)
  
This form works in a simple manner where:
1. Users can enter their **Roll Number** and check if the record exists in the database.
2. If the record doesn't exist, users can fill out other details and save the form.
3. If the record exists, users can update the data with an **Update** button.
